This is educational project and my take on social network similar to Facebook.
I want to learn major web technologies and techniques and this is the best way to learn it.

I'm using Laravel 4.2 PHP framework with MySQL database.
Front end wise I'm using Bootstrap 3 framework (for responsive design and some nice looking components) and jQuery libray alongside HTML, CSS and JavaScript of course.

When deploying online some JavaScript scripts and links in some views should be corrected because they are hard coded which could be a problem.

FEATURES:
*registration system with email activation
*basic authentication system with remember me function
*adding and deleting friends (there are friend requests)
*posting statuses which can be commented and liked
*uploading profile picture
*basic search

USAGE:
1. Clone repository to your machine
2. Run in CMD "composer install"
3. Configure database and mail settings in config folder
4. Run migrations in CMD "php artisan migrate"
