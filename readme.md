This is educational project and my take on social network similar to Facebook.
I want to learn major web technologies and techniques and this is the best way to learn it.

I'm using Laravel 4.2 PHP framework with MySQL database.
Front end wise I'm using Bootstrap 3 framework (for responsive design and some nice looking components) and jQuery libray alongside HTML, CSS and JavaScript of course.

When deploying online some JavaScript scripts and links in some views should be corrected because they are hard coded which could be a problem.
